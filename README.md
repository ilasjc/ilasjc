# ILA Social Justice Committee Resources Site  

## Purpose  

We've made this site to help Idahoans, and Idahoans who work in libraries, find resources and organizations to help make Idaho communities stronger and more equitable.  

## Technology Used  

This site is made using Jekyll, as well as the BlackDoc theme by Karlo Espiritu, which itself is based on Poole. GitHub Pages is the host, which provides https by default.
