# ILA Social Justice Committee Resources Site  

## Purpose  

We've made this site to help Idahoans, and Idahoans who work in libraries, find resources and organizations to help make Idaho communities stronger and more equitable.  

## Technology Used  

This site is made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It uses the [BlackDoc theme](http://karloespiritu.com/blackdoc/) by Karlo Espiritu, which itself is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).  

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is the host, which provides https by default.
