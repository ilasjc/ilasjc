## About This Site  

### Site Purpose  

This site is meant to help you find or share resources. It's built by the Idaho Library Association's [Social Justice Committee](http://www.idaholibraries.org/social_justice_committee) to support our communities.  

### Technical Information  

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme is a modified version of Karlo Espiritu's [BlackDoc Theme](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc), which itself uses both [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com). The heading links use Bryan Braun's [Anchor.js](https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/). Our favicon (the little icon in the browser address bar) is adapted from [Freedom](https://thenounproject.com/visuadio/collection/la-paz/?i=1029373), part of Felipe Alvarado's [La Paz Collection](https://thenounproject.com/visuadio/collection/la-paz/) available at the Noun Project.  

You're [welcome to adapt]( {{ site.baseurl }}/LICENSE.md ) this site for your own needs.
