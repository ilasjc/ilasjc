## About This Site  
{:.no-anchor}

### Site Purpose  

This site is meant to help you find or share resources. It's built by the Idaho Library Association's [Social Justice Committee](http://www.idaholibraries.org/social_justice_committee) to support our communities.  

### Technical Information  

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme is a modified version of Karlo Espiritu's [BlackDoc Theme](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc), which itself uses both [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com). The heading links use Bryan Braun's [Anchor.js](https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/). 

Our site logo is [Freedom](https://thenounproject.com/visuadio/collection/la-paz/?i=1029373), part of Felipe Alvarado's [La Paz](https://thenounproject.com/visuadio/collection/la-paz/) collection available at the Noun Project. We cropped a close-up of it for our favicon (the little image in a browser address bar).
