## Website Creation with Accessibility in Mind    

W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Checklist](https://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-WCAG20-20050630/checklist)  

Web Accessibility in Mind's [WEBAIM page](http://webaim.org) has many tutorials and evaluation tools.  

WEBAIM's [WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation tool)](http://wave.webaim.org) examines websites for accessibility features. It looks at section headings, color contrast, links, alt text, etc. and provides suggestions for improvement.  

[Color-Hex](http://www.color-hex.com) isn't strictly a tool for accessibility, but gives different shades and tints related to a color. If WAVE says you need to increase color contrast, Color-Hex can help you balance your aesthetic preferences with the contrast necessary for accessibility.  

Accesssify's [Accessible Table Builder](http://accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/accessibility-tools/table-builder/) helps you quickly make html tables that are accessible to screen readers.  

## Resources for Library Workers  

ASCLA's [Library Accessibility Tipsheets](http://www.ala.org/ascla/resources/tipsheets) offer tips to help library workers understand and manage access issues across a range of accessibility issues.  

ASCLA's [Think Accessibile Before You Buy](http://www.ala.org/ascla/asclaprotools/thinkaccessible/default) provides questions to ask before purchasing electronic resources.
